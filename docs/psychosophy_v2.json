We all know that the third function in psychosophy is dual, but this also applies to some extent to the first function. So, 1F is under the yoke of their physical inclinations and addictions, 1E is under the yoke of their feelings and experiences, 1L is dependent on their opinions and ideas about the world. 1V are not free from their own desires, which they identify with their 'I'. Refusing to achieve what you want, for 1V, is tantamount to ceasing to be yourself. For the reason that it is impossible for 1V to give up their desire and they strive with all their heart for its realization, then there is almost always a way for this. As the saying goes, he who seeks will find. Therefore, statements 1V, which irritate 3V so much, that if you want, you will find a way to achieve, are not unfounded and are based on your own positive experience. In addition, the First Volitions are devoid of guilt for their actions, they take their essence (and therefore their actions and the desires that led to them) for granted. They make good leaders, because they do not tend to complex because of the inconsistency of themselves with the place they occupy, which means they artificially create “show-offs” around themselves. On the contrary, they enthusiastically take responsibility for the common cause and practically identify it with themselves.",

At the same time, they react sharply to disrespect for themselves, ignoring, they are offended where the other would not have found a reason. Having learned 3V closer, you definitely come across his complexes: whining on the topic 'I am a nonentity, a loser, I will not achieve anything in life' is the norm for the Third Volitions. It looks like she finds more and more reasons for self-abasement. However, if the situation becomes critical, 3V suddenly performs volitional actions that change her life, which invariably surprises those around her. At the right moment, 3V knows how to pull himself together. These people are responsible; they are afraid to let others down and run into disapproval. Understanding the intricacies of the social hierarchy is a constant desire of 3V. They strive to realize and improve their status in society, at the same time they evaluate other people in terms of their place on the social ladder. Often 3Vs have problems with a sense of humor. They find it difficult to laugh at themselves; they love cruel jokes that humiliate people - this, again, is connected with the hierarchical consciousness of this function. It is common for the Third Volitions to protect their social status by any means - including with the help of lies and pretense. They use 'show-offs', trying to show themselves better than they really are. Their slogan is “better to seem than to be” (as opposed to 1V, for example).

It is important to note that each holder of the First Logic is stubborn in his own way, but at the same time he absolutely does not want to devote his attention to persuading others.
